# Liquid-Go

A suprisingly fun game I made in Processing. Go is Chinese and Japanese board game about controlling teritory. It is turn based and played on a grid. This is go except played with "liquid" in real time, instead of discreet stones placed in discreet steps. You and your opponent both pour liquid at the same rate, and your goal is to surround your opponent. Much like in go, you can pour liquid on any empty spot on the board, you cannot pour liquid where there is already liquid, the liquid stays where it was poured, and you want to take away liberties of your opponent's liquid. Replace "pour" with "place" and "liquid" with "stones" and you have most of the rules of go.

Coming soon:
-Multiplayer
-Liquid Chess (you have a fixed amount of liquid at the start of the game, it moves towards your cursor, and it can overwrite your opponent's liquid.)
-Smoother look
-Better AI
-Better language and better code (the pixels begin drawn to the screen and the game board are the same array, not smart lol)
